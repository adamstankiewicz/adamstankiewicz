### Hi there! 👋 I'm Adam

I am a full-stack software engineer with over 8 years of experience in frontend architecture, design systems, and user experience. I thrive on solving complex challenges and creating impactful solutions, particularly in the edtech space.

- 🛠️ **Technical Leadership:** I lead the frontend architecture for edX Enterprise, supporting over 1.2 million learners and promoting frontend architecture best practices within the Open edX community.

- ⚙️ **Design Systems Expertise:** Developed Paragon, an open-source design system and React component library used in over 40 projects, serving more than 100 million learners. I collaborate closely with designers to ensure our UI components are accessible, user-friendly, and aligned with user needs. I also integrate user feedback and data insights to create experiences that resonate with users.

- ✈️ **Personal Interests:** I am a private pilot and proud owner of a Cessna 172. I have an Australian Cattle Dog who keeps life interesting, and I was a former member of the U.S. Boomerang Team.

- 💬 **Let's Connect:** I'm eager to discuss creating scalable systems that enhance user and developer experiences. If you're interested in collaborating or sharing insights on frontend architecture, design systems, or product development, feel free to reach out!
