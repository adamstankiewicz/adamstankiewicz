### Hi there 👋 I'm Adam

I am a **product-minded full-stack software engineer** with over **8 years of experience** in full-stack product development, specializing in **frontend architecture, design systems,** and **user experience**. I thrive on solving complex challenges and delivering scalable solutions that enhance user engagement, particularly within the **edtech space**.

### Key Highlights:

My strategic direction has been pivotal in aligning technical solutions with business objectives.

- ⚙️ **Design Systems Expertise:** Spearheaded the development of **Paragon**, an open-source design system and React component library for the **Open edX platform**, serving over **50 million learners** globally. Collaborated with designers to deliver accessible and cohesive UI components across **40+ projects**, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- 🧭 **Mentorship and Collaboration:** Committed to fostering a collaborative environment, I mentor engineers and promote knowledge sharing through code reviews, pair programming, and cross-functional teamwork. I champion best practices in accessibility and scalable design across the organization.

- ✈️ **Personal Interests:** Outside of work, I am a **private pilot** and aircraft owner (Cessna 172), and I take pride in being a dedicated owner of an **Australian Cattle Dog**. These interests inspire my creativity and enhance my approach to thoughtful product development.
